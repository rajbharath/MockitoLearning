                i) no of attendees of that event is <= the conference room capacity
                ii) Date of event should not fall in time of room maintenance date 
                iii) Conference Room should not have a booking on that event date and time. Conference Room checks with its Booking History for this condition.
5. Repeat step 7 to 9 till for all the events in the Conference
